# Mediatek Voltage Control

Tool for Android smartphones to control the CPU voltage from mediatek (Under/Over volting)

# How to use

1. You need a rooted device!

2. Install [Pydroid3 IDE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3), [Pydroid3 Permissions Plugin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroidpermissionsplugin)

3. Open the Pydroid3 IDE configure it, then open my project file and run it. You will need to allow access to root in your root manager.

# Recommendations and information

1. Successfully tested on processors: mt6769t (Helio G80), mt6769z (Helio G85)

2. If you specify low values, the phone may freeze completely. Just do an emergency reboot.

3. I do not recommend the use of higher voltage of course if you do not want to kill the phone :)
